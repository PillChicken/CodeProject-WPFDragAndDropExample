# CodeProject-WPFDragAndDropExample
WPF natively supports drag and drop operations - that is, you the developer get some information when a UI element is dragged across the screen and then dropped on another UI element, but from a user's perspective, there's no feedback. If we want some kind of visual cue, (mouse cursor change, ghosted preview, or moving the element itself) we the developers have to add that functionality.

This project provides drag and drop gesture support with a ghosted preview to WPF using MVVM style architecture.
